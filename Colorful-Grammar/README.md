This website allows you to type all over the screen and watch the color of your screen change based on the number of verbs, nouns, adjectives, and adverbs in the text.

We’re going to be creating our color with the HSL (Hue, Saturation, Luminosity) color system. 
HSL system uses a color wheel, and you identify a color according to its position on the color wheel in degrees. Also important to note is that colors start a new cycle once you pass 360°. Just like a 60° angle looks the same as a 420 (360 + 60)° angle, 60° on the HSL color system is the same color as 420°: yellow.
